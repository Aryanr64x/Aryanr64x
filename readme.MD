My Skillset include technologies that are widely adopted in the industry . React is the core of frontend skillset with Nextjs being used for making oustanding websites and React Native for mobile app.

For the backend I embrace NodeJS with the express framework along with MongoDB as the exclusive backend.

These skills only scratch the surface when talking about my passion for software development. I am confident in my ability to easily adopt other frontend or backend technologies that may be required for any particular project.
